# OMDB
Omdb is a single page application developed by me for studying purposes using react, scss, redux and also dependencies like react-router-dom, react-reveal... 
The name of the application is based on the OMDB api which you can find by clicking [here](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

yarn install 
```

You may start the server with:

    or
yarn start
```
